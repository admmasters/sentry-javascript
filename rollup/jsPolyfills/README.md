### Javascript Polyfills

This is a collection of syntax polyfills either copied directly from or heavily inspired by those used by [Rollup](https://github.com/rollup/rollup) and [Sucrase](https://github.com/alangpierce/sucrase). When either tool uses one of these polyfills during a build, it injects the function source code into each file needing the function, which can lead to a great deal of duplication. For our builds, we have therefore implemented something similar to [`tsc`'s `importHelpers` behavior](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#importHelpers): Instead of leaving the polyfills injected in multiple places, we instead replace each injected function with an `import` or `require` statement. This directory is the location from which we import. For simplicity (and greater treeshaking ability when using tools which only work on a file-by-file level), each polyfill lives in its own file.

During build, this directory is copied over to the root level of `@sentry/utils`, and the polyfills are compiled into esm and cjs versions. When the injected implementations are replaced by either `import` or `require` by our rollup plugin, each `import`/`require` pulls from the correct module format's folder. (In other words, the injected `import` statements import from `@sentry/utils/jsPolyfills/esm` and the injected `require` statements pull from `@sentry/utils/jsPolyfills/cjs`.)
